## Introduction

**NullVault** is a Python-based forensic utility designed to bypass or brute-force Android device lockscreens in controlled environments. It is primarily intended for digital forensic analysts, penetration testers, and incident responders with authorized access to test devices.

This tool supports both rooted and non-rooted ADB-enabled Android devices and performs a range of actions such as lockscreen bypass, 4-digit PIN brute-force, full device backup, file system snapshots, and device info PDF generation.


## Features
- üîì **Lockscreen Bypass** (Rooted)  
- üî¢ **4-Digit PIN Brute Force** (Non-rooted, ADB Keyevent)  
- üß† **Auto-Detection of Android Version and Lock Type**  
- üìÅ **PDF Report Generator**  
- üì∑ **File System Snapshot for Offline Analysis**  
- üì∂ **Wi-Fi Password & SMS/Call Log Extraction**  
- üì¶ **Import `locksettings.db` for Offline Cracking**  
- üìÉ **Auto-Generated Reports Named with Device Info**  
- üîÑ **Main Menu Loop ‚Äì No Script Restart Needed**  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tested on Real Devices with ADB/Root Access**
